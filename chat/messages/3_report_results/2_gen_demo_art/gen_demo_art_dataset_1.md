**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built a real corpus of 15 well-known, well-documented open-source GitHub repositories (e.g. pallets/flask, BurntSushi/ripgrep,
  psf/black, Textualize/rich, httpie/cli, pyenv/pyenv, tiangolo/typer), each with full commit history obtained via `git clone`
  + `git log --numstat` (SHA, author name/email, ISO date, per-file insertions/deletions for every commit, newest-first, capped
  at 5,000 commits/repo with an explicit truncation flag) plus repo-level metadata from the GitHub REST API (stars, forks,
  primary language, license, created_at, pushed_at, open_issues, README excerpt). Each repo record also carries an empirically-computed
  `founder_signal`: the fraction of commits in the repo's first 365 days made by its single top-committing author email, and
  the top author's email. This directly operationalizes the plan's inclusion criterion (single-founder dominance >=70% of
  year-1 commits) without asserting it a priori -- it is measured from the real cloned git log. Repos span multiple languages
  (Python, Rust) and star bands (15k-72k stars in the current sample) and multi-year histories (6.6-16.4 years), giving enough
  post-founding history for an 18-month post-departure survival window. IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITATION: this environment has no
  GITHUB_TOKEN, so the GitHub REST API is capped at 60 unauthenticated requests/hour (2 calls per repo: /repos/{full_name}
  and its /readme). This makes the plan's 150-250 repo target infeasible within the artifact time budget -- 15 repos were
  completed and checkpointed (12 in the final checkpoint snapshot, 15 repo-record files on disk) before the artifact needed
  to finalize; git clone itself (smart-HTTP) is NOT rate-limited, so every completed repo's commit history is complete and
  untruncated for its cap, only the TOTAL repo count is reduced. code/build_dataset.py and code/candidates.py contain a ~104-repo
  candidate list spanning Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Rust/C++/Java and a checkpointed, resumable pipeline (temp/checkpoint.json) that
  a downstream step can re-run with a GITHUB_TOKEN (raising the limit to 5,000 req/hour) to scale to the full 150-250 target
  without re-doing completed work. A HuggingFace candidate (kamalkishor1991/commit-messages-dataset, sampled commit diffs
  for commit-message generation) was evaluated and explicitly rejected as the primary source because it lacks per-repo lifecycle,
  author-identity-over-time, and per-file structure. data.py standardizes the corpus into the exp_sel_data_out.json schema:
  one dataset group `github_founder_departure_commits`, one example per repo, `input` = JSON-encoded {repo_metadata, founder_signal,
  truncated, commit_cap, commits[]}, `output` = derived label 'founder_dominant'/'not_founder_dominant' from the 0.7 year-1-share
  threshold, plus flat `metadata_*` fields (full_name, stars, language, history_years, n_commits, truncated, year1_top_author_share,
  task_type). Validated against the exp_sel_data_out schema (PASSED); full_data_out.json is 13.8MB (well under the 100MB limit),
  with mini_data_out.json and preview_data_out.json also produced.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_ZuMis522AEPF/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)
</task>

<artifact_info>
id: art_ZuMis522AEPF
type: dataset
title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built a real corpus of 15 well-known, well-documented open-source GitHub repositories (e.g. pallets/flask, BurntSushi/ripgrep,
  psf/black, Textualize/rich, httpie/cli, pyenv/pyenv, tiangolo/typer), each with full commit history obtained via `git clone`
  + `git log --numstat` (SHA, author name/email, ISO date, per-file insertions/deletions for every commit, newest-first, capped
  at 5,000 commits/repo with an explicit truncation flag) plus repo-level metadata from the GitHub REST API (stars, forks,
  primary language, license, created_at, pushed_at, open_issues, README excerpt). Each repo record also carries an empirically-computed
  `founder_signal`: the fraction of commits in the repo's first 365 days made by its single top-committing author email, and
  the top author's email. This directly operationalizes the plan's inclusion criterion (single-founder dominance >=70% of
  year-1 commits) without asserting it a priori -- it is measured from the real cloned git log. Repos span multiple languages
  (Python, Rust) and star bands (15k-72k stars in the current sample) and multi-year histories (6.6-16.4 years), giving enough
  post-founding history for an 18-month post-departure survival window. IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITATION: this environment has no
  GITHUB_TOKEN, so the GitHub REST API is capped at 60 unauthenticated requests/hour (2 calls per repo: /repos/{full_name}
  and its /readme). This makes the plan's 150-250 repo target infeasible within the artifact time budget -- 15 repos were
  completed and checkpointed (12 in the final checkpoint snapshot, 15 repo-record files on disk) before the artifact needed
  to finalize; git clone itself (smart-HTTP) is NOT rate-limited, so every completed repo's commit history is complete and
  untruncated for its cap, only the TOTAL repo count is reduced. code/build_dataset.py and code/candidates.py contain a ~104-repo
  candidate list spanning Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Rust/C++/Java and a checkpointed, resumable pipeline (temp/checkpoint.json) that
  a downstream step can re-run with a GITHUB_TOKEN (raising the limit to 5,000 req/hour) to scale to the full 150-250 target
  without re-doing completed work. A HuggingFace candidate (kamalkishor1991/commit-messages-dataset, sampled commit diffs
  for commit-message generation) was evaluated and explicitly rejected as the primary source because it lacks per-repo lifecycle,
  author-identity-over-time, and per-file structure. data.py standardizes the corpus into the exp_sel_data_out.json schema:
  one dataset group `github_founder_departure_commits`, one example per repo, `input` = JSON-encoded {repo_metadata, founder_signal,
  truncated, commit_cap, commits[]}, `output` = derived label 'founder_dominant'/'not_founder_dominant' from the 0.7 year-1-share
  threshold, plus flat `metadata_*` fields (full_name, stars, language, history_years, n_commits, truncated, year1_top_author_share,
  task_type). Validated against the exp_sel_data_out schema (PASSED); full_data_out.json is 13.8MB (well under the 100MB limit),
  with mini_data_out.json and preview_data_out.json also produced.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').

**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`

title: GitHub Founder-Departure Commit Corpus
summary: >-
  Built a real corpus of 15 well-known, well-documented open-source GitHub repositories (e.g. pallets/flask, BurntSushi/ripgrep,
  psf/black, Textualize/rich, httpie/cli, pyenv/pyenv, tiangolo/typer), each with full commit history obtained via `git clone`
  + `git log --numstat` (SHA, author name/email, ISO date, per-file insertions/deletions for every commit, newest-first, capped
  at 5,000 commits/repo with an explicit truncation flag) plus repo-level metadata from the GitHub REST API (stars, forks,
  primary language, license, created_at, pushed_at, open_issues, README excerpt). Each repo record also carries an empirically-computed
  `founder_signal`: the fraction of commits in the repo's first 365 days made by its single top-committing author email, and
  the top author's email. This directly operationalizes the plan's inclusion criterion (single-founder dominance >=70% of
  year-1 commits) without asserting it a priori -- it is measured from the real cloned git log. Repos span multiple languages
  (Python, Rust) and star bands (15k-72k stars in the current sample) and multi-year histories (6.6-16.4 years), giving enough
  post-founding history for an 18-month post-departure survival window. IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITATION: this environment has no
  GITHUB_TOKEN, so the GitHub REST API is capped at 60 unauthenticated requests/hour (2 calls per repo: /repos/{full_name}
  and its /readme). This makes the plan's 150-250 repo target infeasible within the artifact time budget -- 15 repos were
  completed and checkpointed (12 in the final checkpoint snapshot, 15 repo-record files on disk) before the artifact needed
  to finalize; git clone itself (smart-HTTP) is NOT rate-limited, so every completed repo's commit history is complete and
  untruncated for its cap, only the TOTAL repo count is reduced. code/build_dataset.py and code/candidates.py contain a ~104-repo
  candidate list spanning Python/JS/Go/Ruby/Rust/C++/Java and a checkpointed, resumable pipeline (temp/checkpoint.json) that
  a downstream step can re-run with a GITHUB_TOKEN (raising the limit to 5,000 req/hour) to scale to the full 150-250 target
  without re-doing completed work. A HuggingFace candidate (kamalkishor1991/commit-messages-dataset, sampled commit diffs
  for commit-message generation) was evaluated and explicitly rejected as the primary source because it lacks per-repo lifecycle,
  author-identity-over-time, and per-file structure. data.py standardizes the corpus into the exp_sel_data_out.json schema:
  one dataset group `github_founder_departure_commits`, one example per repo, `input` = JSON-encoded {repo_metadata, founder_signal,
  truncated, commit_cap, commits[]}, `output` = derived label 'founder_dominant'/'not_founder_dominant' from the 0.7 year-1-share
  threshold, plus flat `metadata_*` fields (full_name, stars, language, history_years, n_commits, truncated, year1_top_author_share,
  task_type). Validated against the exp_sel_data_out schema (PASSED); full_data_out.json is 13.8MB (well under the 100MB limit),
  with mini_data_out.json and preview_data_out.json also produced.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

The notebook content looks complete and reasonable already. It's missing cell 14 (the `standardized_examples = build_github_examples(repo_records)` call). Let me check and mini_demo_data.json content too.
