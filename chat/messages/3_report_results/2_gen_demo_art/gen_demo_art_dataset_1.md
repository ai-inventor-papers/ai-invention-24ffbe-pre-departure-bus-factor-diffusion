**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_24Q1bYB_ULpu/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: dataset
title: Founder-Departure OSS Truck-Factor Corpus
summary: >-
  This dataset mines real GitHub repositories to test whether pre-departure authority diffusion predicts whether an open-source
  project survives its founder stepping away. Candidates (1,615 repos) were discovered via the GitHub Search API stratified
  across 6 languages (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby) and 3 star-count buckets (100-2000, 2000-10000, >10000) to
  avoid confounding popularity with survival. Full commit history for each candidate was pulled via `git clone --filter=blob:none`
  (partial clone, no blob content, unlimited by GitHub API rate limits) plus `git log --name-only`, giving per-commit (author
  email, date, files changed) tuples with no cloning-scale API cost. From this raw history the pipeline computes, per year,
  the exact Degree-of-Authorship metric from Avelino et al. (ICPC 2016): DOA(d,f) = 3.293 + 1.098*FirstAuthor(d,f) + 0.164*Deliveries(d,f)
  - 0.321*ln(1+Acceptances(d,f)), and the Truck Factor via the paper's greedy algorithm (repeatedly remove the highest-file-count
  DOA-primary author while remaining authors still cover >=50% of files). A Truck-Factor-Developer-Detachment (TFDD) is flagged
  the first year the sole (TF=1) truck-factor developer has been silent >=1 year and is confirmed to be the project's founder
  (earliest committer with dominant early-commit share). Algorithm correctness was validated against the paper's own worked
  example (composer/satis): the reproduced TF sequence (1,1,1,2,2,2,...) and TFDD detection matches the paper's Figure 1 exactly.
  Of 216 candidates processed, 32 qualified with a founder-only TFDD plus >=3 years of subsequent history (avoiding right-censoring);
  184 were discarded and logged with reasons (no qualifying TFDD 120, non-software/low-code-fraction 24, too few commits 15,
  right-censored 11, migration/squash mining artifact 11, history too large 3). Each of the 32 output rows (dataset group
  'founder_departure_tfdd_corpus' in full_data_out.json, schema exp_sel_data_out.json) has `input` = a JSON string of pre-TFDD/TFDD-snapshot
  covariates (founder's pre-departure commit share, count of new non-founder DOA-primary file owners in the 6-12mo pre-TFDD
  window, founder's early authorship share, stars, forks, contributor count, language, license, project age, total commits/files,
  history span) and `output` = the survival label (Active_survived / Inactive_did_not_survive per Avelino et al.'s Active/Inactive
  model: did a new truck-factor developer arrive and commit activity persist for >=6 months post-TFDD). Rich metadata_* fields
  on every example carry the full per-year DOA/TF developer-set tables, TFDD date/developer/silence-duration, the pre-TFDD
  window details, TFDD-snapshot covariates, the 18-month post-TFDD monthly commit-count time series, activity bucket (thriving/maintained/dormant/dead),
  repo identity/URL/stars/language/license, and first/last commit dates -- enough for downstream experiment code to recompute
  or verify the authority-diffusion trajectory without re-cloning any repository. The corpus spans 5 languages (Go 7, Ruby
  11, JavaScript 6, Java 5, Rust 3) and both survival outcomes (20 Active_survived, 12 Inactive_did_not_survive), is 175KB
  (well under the 300MB budget), and passed exp_sel_data_out.json schema validation. Mining code (search_candidates.py, mine_repo.py,
  run_mining.py, data.py) is included for full reproducibility and to extend the corpus further if a downstream experiment
  wants a larger sample.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>
