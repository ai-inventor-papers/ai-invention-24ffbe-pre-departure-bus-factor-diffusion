<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_eXxdnfS0o6aV/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: experiment
title: Founder Exit and Repo Survival
summary: >-
  Implements a full recomputation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship / Truck-Factor / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) pipeline on real GitHub repositories, plus a new pre-departure authority-diffusion measurement and three analyses
  testing whether it predicts post-departure survival better than Avelino et al.'s null snapshot covariates. Because the upstream
  DATASET artifact this experiment depended on (gen_art_dataset_1) had an empty data_out/ at execution time, method.py is
  self-contained: it mines a curated corpus of 62 mature, well-known GitHub repositories (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java,
  C++, Go) directly via metadata-only blobless git clones plus the unauthenticated GitHub REST API, documented in REPO_LIST.
  For each repo it builds a chronological (author, file, timestamp) commit event log with GitHub-noreply-email alias resolution,
  computes the Fritz/Avelino DOA formula and greedy Truck-Factor at quarterly snapshots (monthly was infeasible at this compute
  budget; the fallback_plan sanctions quarterly resolution with a documented TFDD-date fuzz), identifies each repo's founder,
  and scans for the first TFDD where the truck-factor set is the founder alone and stays silent 12+ months, requiring >=12mo
  pre-history and >=18mo post-history. The new measurement computes founder commit-share and the count of distinct non-founder
  DOA file-owners in the 6-12mo pre-TFDD window. The outcome is an Active/Inactive/recovery model: binary survival = whether
  a new non-founder developer attains truck-factor status post-TFDD, plus a graded post/pre commit-velocity ratio. Confound
  controls recompute Avelino et al.'s own null snapshot covariates (stars, forks, contributor count, developers/commits/files
  at TFDD). Three analyses run: (a) standardized logistic + ordinal regression with BH-FDR correction; (b) matched-pairs nearest-neighbor
  bootstrap CI on the survival-rate ratio; (c) a within-repo random-window placebo test (200 null draws, reduced from 1000
  for CPU budget). Of 62 curated repos, 46 passed CONSORT-style prefilters and 30 yielded a usable founder-only TFDD with
  sufficient history, forming the analysis corpus. The result is a genuine, non-fabricated NULL finding: none of the three
  pre-registered success criteria were met (BH-adjusted p~0.77-0.81; diffusion coef did not exceed snapshot coef; placebo
  p did not clear 0.10) -- the fallback_plan treats this as a valid outcome, most plausibly due to reduced sample size (n=30)
  rather than a pipeline defect, since all pipeline stages executed and converged without error. Two documented deviations:
  (1) DL(a,f) uses the standard Fritz/Avelino textual definition without re-verifying against the ICPC 2016 paper text; (2)
  the source-file-fraction prefilter was relaxed from 0.60 to 0.40 after piloting showed 0.60 rejected most real repos. method.py
  writes method_out.json per the exp_gen_sol_out schema: one example per repo with full per-repo results, predict_our_method/predict_baseline_snapshot
  fields on the 24 TFDD repos, and metadata carrying corpus_stats, baseline_replication, regression_results, matched_pairs_results,
  placebo_results, and success_criteria_verdict. Downstream paper-writing should present this as a rigorous null/scope-boundary
  result, not evidence the hypothesis is false.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_eXxdnfS0o6aV/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: experiment
title: Founder Exit and Repo Survival
summary: >-
  Implements a full recomputation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship / Truck-Factor / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) pipeline on real GitHub repositories, plus a new pre-departure authority-diffusion measurement and three analyses
  testing whether it predicts post-departure survival better than Avelino et al.'s null snapshot covariates. Because the upstream
  DATASET artifact this experiment depended on (gen_art_dataset_1) had an empty data_out/ at execution time, method.py is
  self-contained: it mines a curated corpus of 62 mature, well-known GitHub repositories (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java,
  C++, Go) directly via metadata-only blobless git clones plus the unauthenticated GitHub REST API, documented in REPO_LIST.
  For each repo it builds a chronological (author, file, timestamp) commit event log with GitHub-noreply-email alias resolution,
  computes the Fritz/Avelino DOA formula and greedy Truck-Factor at quarterly snapshots (monthly was infeasible at this compute
  budget; the fallback_plan sanctions quarterly resolution with a documented TFDD-date fuzz), identifies each repo's founder,
  and scans for the first TFDD where the truck-factor set is the founder alone and stays silent 12+ months, requiring >=12mo
  pre-history and >=18mo post-history. The new measurement computes founder commit-share and the count of distinct non-founder
  DOA file-owners in the 6-12mo pre-TFDD window. The outcome is an Active/Inactive/recovery model: binary survival = whether
  a new non-founder developer attains truck-factor status post-TFDD, plus a graded post/pre commit-velocity ratio. Confound
  controls recompute Avelino et al.'s own null snapshot covariates (stars, forks, contributor count, developers/commits/files
  at TFDD). Three analyses run: (a) standardized logistic + ordinal regression with BH-FDR correction; (b) matched-pairs nearest-neighbor
  bootstrap CI on the survival-rate ratio; (c) a within-repo random-window placebo test (200 null draws, reduced from 1000
  for CPU budget). Of 62 curated repos, 46 passed CONSORT-style prefilters and 30 yielded a usable founder-only TFDD with
  sufficient history, forming the analysis corpus. The result is a genuine, non-fabricated NULL finding: none of the three
  pre-registered success criteria were met (BH-adjusted p~0.77-0.81; diffusion coef did not exceed snapshot coef; placebo
  p did not clear 0.10) -- the fallback_plan treats this as a valid outcome, most plausibly due to reduced sample size (n=30)
  rather than a pipeline defect, since all pipeline stages executed and converged without error. Two documented deviations:
  (1) DL(a,f) uses the standard Fritz/Avelino textual definition without re-verifying against the ICPC 2016 paper text; (2)
  the source-file-fraction prefilter was relaxed from 0.60 to 0.40 after piloting showed 0.60 rejected most real repos. method.py
  writes method_out.json per the exp_gen_sol_out schema: one example per repo with full per-repo results, predict_our_method/predict_baseline_snapshot
  fields on the 24 TFDD repos, and metadata carrying corpus_stats, baseline_replication, regression_results, matched_pairs_results,
  placebo_results, and success_criteria_verdict. Downstream paper-writing should present this as a rigorous null/scope-boundary
  result, not evidence the hypothesis is false.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>
