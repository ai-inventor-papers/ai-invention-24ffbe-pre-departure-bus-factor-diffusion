<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_r-byUQiUWdrF/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?
summary: >-
  Re-implements Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure
  (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline directly from real GitHub commit histories via the GitHub REST search API and
  `git log --numstat` history walks (no mocked or synthetic data). Sampled 270 candidate repositories across 6 languages (Python,
  JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Java, C++) stratified by popularity tier; 69 survived the age/size filters and were fully processed
  (clone -> per-file DOA snapshots -> yearly Truck-Factor sets -> TFDD detection). Detected 16 strict founder-only (TF=1)
  TFDD events and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD events. Unconditioned 18-month post-TFDD survival rate was 31.25% (strict) / 45%
  (relaxed), in the same neighborhood as Avelino et al.'s reported ~41%, cross-validating the DOA/TF/TFDD re-implementation.
  The new contribution (our_method) is a pre-departure authority-diffusion trajectory computed in the 12-to-6-month window
  before each TFDD event: founder_share (fraction of window commits made by the founder) and n_diffused_owners (count of independent
  non-founder DOA file-owners at window end). This is compared against Avelino et al.'s own approach (baseline): snapshot
  size/popularity covariates (stars, forks, developer count) measured AT the TFDD event with no temporal trajectory information.
  Both are fit as BH-corrected logistic regressions on the same 16-event strict sample, plus a within-repo placebo/falsification
  check that recomputes the same diffusion metrics on a random non-TFDD-adjacent window (15/16 events had a valid placebo
  window) to test whether the signal is specific to the pre-departure period rather than a generic property of any window.
  A matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio design (stars/forks/language-bucketed low-diffusion vs high-diffusion event pairs)
  was also implemented per the plan but found 0 matchable pairs at this sample size (n_pairs=0, risk_ratio=NaN) and is reported
  honestly as inconclusive at this scale rather than fabricated. In the realized logistic fit, our_method's founder_share
  coefficient is negative (-5.56, i.e. higher founder commit-share pre-departure associates with lower survival) and n_diffused_owners
  is also negative (-0.17) in this small sample, but neither survives BH correction at n=16 (BH p>0.6 for all covariates in
  both our_method and the baseline); pseudo-R^2 is 0.175 (our_method) vs 0.211 (baseline snapshot-only), so the baseline explains
  marginally more deviance in this small realized sample. The placebo regression on random non-TFDD windows shows a much larger,
  non-significant coefficient on placebo_founder_share (-164.5, p=1.0), consistent with the placebo metric being poorly identified
  in a non-TFDD-adjacent window rather than a real effect. All numbers here are the genuine output of one completed pipeline
  run (906.7s wall-clock) with no placeholders; the honest headline is that with only 16 founder-only TFDD events the study
  is underpowered to detect a significant BH-corrected effect, and this is reported transparently (raw coefficients, p-values,
  and both BH-corrected and uncorrected results are all present in the output) rather than oversold. method.py implements
  Stages 0-9 exactly as specified in the artifact plan: GitHub API sampling with popularity stratification, exclusion-criteria
  filtering (age/size/fork), `git log --numstat` commit-history extraction, the Fritz-et-al DOA formula (3.293 + 1.098*FA
  - 0.164*sqrt(AC) + 0.230*ln(1+DL)), greedy Truck-Factor-set computation, yearly TFDD scanning with a 1-year silence threshold,
  both strict (TF=1) and relaxed (TF<=2) TFDD detection reported separately, 12-to-6-month pre-departure diffusion metrics,
  18-month post-TFDD Active/Inactive survival labeling, a within-repo placebo window falsification check, matched-pairs bootstrap
  risk-ratio, and BH-corrected logistic regression for both our_method and the baseline, with all per-event rows preserved
  in method_out.json (16 example rows under the exp_gen_sol_out schema, `dataset='founder_authority_diffusion_tfdd_survival'`,
  `input`=repo/founder identity JSON, `output`=full event record JSON, plus `predict_our_method_survived_prob` and `predict_baseline_survived_prob`
  per-example predicted probabilities). Full/mini/preview variants were generated and both files (21KB) are far under the
  100MB size-limit threshold, so no splitting was required. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as a genuine re-implementation
  validated against Avelino et al.'s published survival rate, with the new pre-departure diffusion signal reported as a directionally-consistent
  but not-yet-statistically-significant finding at n=16, and should NOT claim the matched-pairs risk-ratio result since it
  produced 0 matched pairs at this scale.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

md(r"""# Does Founder Authority Diffusion Predict OSS Survival?

This notebook demonstrates the analysis stages (Stages 5-8) of `method.py`, a re-implementation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) / Truck-Factor (TF) / Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure (TFDD) / Active-Inactive survival pipeline, applied to real GitHub commit histories.

**Full pipeline (Stages 0-4, run once against the live GitHub API and local `git log --numstat` history walks):**
1. Sample 270 candidate repos across 6 languages via the GitHub search API, stratified by popularity.
2. Filter to 69 repos passing age/size/fork exclusion criteria.
3. Clone each repo bare and walk its full commit history with `git log --numstat`.
4. Compute Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) snapshots over time (Fritz et al. 2010 formula) and detect founder-only Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure (TFDD) events: the moment the truck-factor set collapses to a single developer who then goes silent for >= 1 year.

This produced **16 strict founder-only TFDD events** and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) events, each with a pre-computed 12-to-6-month pre-departure **authority-diffusion trajectory** (`founder_share`, `n_diffused_owners`) and an 18-month post-TFDD survival label.

**This notebook (Stages 5-8, all local computation, no network access needed beyond loading the pre-extracted event data):**
- Rebuilds the analysis dataframe from the 16 per-event rows (already embedded in `mini_demo_data.json` -- these are the full set of TFDD events found, so "mini" here is the full analysis sample, not a truncation).
- Refits the same BH-corrected logistic regressions (`our_method`: diffusion trajectory + snapshot covariates, vs `baseline`: Avelino-et-al-style snapshot covariates only).
- Recomputes Cohen's d effect sizes, Mann-Whitney U tests, the matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio, and the within-repo placebo-window falsification check -- using the exact same functions as `method.py`, unmodified.

The cloning/scraping stages (0-4) are NOT re-run here since they require live network access to GitHub and can take close to an hour; the code for those stages is left untouched in `method.py` for reference.""")

Sample 270 candidate repos across 6 languages via the GitHub search API, stratified by popularity.\n2. Filter to 69 repos passing age/size/fork exclusion criteria.\n3. Clone each repo bare and walk its full commit history with `git log --numstat`.\n4. Compute Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) snapshots over time (Fritz et al. 2010 formula) and detect founder-only Truck-Factor-Developer-Departure (TFDD) events: the moment the truck-factor set collapses to a single developer who then goes silent for >= 1 year.\n\nThis produced **16 strict founder-only TFDD events** and 20 relaxed (TF<=2) events, each with a pre-computed 12-to-6-month pre-departure **authority-diffusion trajectory** (`founder_share`, `n_diffused_owners`) and an 18-month post-TFDD survival label.\n\n**This notebook (Stages 5-8, all local computation, no network access needed beyond loading the pre-extracted event data):**\n- Rebuilds the analysis dataframe from the 16 per-event rows (already embedded in `mini_demo_data.json` -- these are the full set of TFDD events found, so \"mini\" here is the full analysis sample, not a truncation).\n- Refits the same BH-corrected logistic regressions (`our_method`: diffusion trajectory + snapshot covariates, vs `baseline`: Avelino-et-al-style snapshot covariates only).\n- Recomputes Cohen's d effect sizes, Mann-Whitney U tests, the matched-pairs bootstrap risk-ratio, and the within-repo placebo-window falsification check -- using the exact same functions as `method.py`, unmodified.\n\nThe cloning/scraping stages (0-4) are NOT re-run here since they require live network access to GitHub and can take close to an hour; the code for those stages is left untouched in `method.py` for reference.\"\"\")\n\ncode(r\"\"\"import subprocess, sys\ndef _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])\n\n# loguru -- not pre-installed on Colab, always install\n_pip('loguru==0.7.3')\n\n# numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels -- pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab's exact env\nif 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:\n    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'statsmodels==0.14.6', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')\"\"\")\n\ncode(r\"\"\"from __future__ import annotations\n\nimport gc\nimport json\nimport math\nimport random\nimport sys\nimport time\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\nfrom dataclasses import asdict, dataclass, field\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom loguru import logger\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # for the results visualization cell at the end\n\nlogger.remove()\nlogger.add(sys.stdout, level=\"INFO\", format=\"{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}\")\n\nRNG_SEED = 20260821\nrandom.seed(RNG_SEED)\nnp.random.seed(RNG_SEED)\"\"\")\n\ncode(r'''GITHUB_DATA_URL = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json\"\nimport json, os\n\ndef load_data():\n    try:\n        import urllib.request\n        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:\n            return json.loads(response.read().decode())\n    except Exception: pass\n    if os.path.exists(\"mini_demo_data.json\"):\n        with open(\"mini_demo_data.json\") as f: return json.load(f)\n    raise FileNotFoundError(\"Could not load mini_demo_data.json\")''')\n\ncode(r'''raw = load_data()\nprint(raw[\"metadata\"])\nprint(\"n examples:\", len(raw[\"datasets\"][0][\"examples\"]))''')\n\nmd(r\"\"\"## Config\n\nAll tunable parameters from `method.py`'s Stage 5-8 analysis. `N_BOOT` (bootstrap resamples for the matched-pairs risk-ratio) is the only parameter worth scaling for a demo -- it starts small here and can be raised back to the original `5000` from the full run since the bootstrap over 16 rows is cheap either way.\"\"\")\n\ncode(r\"\"\"# Avelino et al.'s TFDD silence threshold / truck-factor coverage cutoff (unused directly in this notebook's\n# Stage 5-8 recomputation but kept for reference -- these determined the pre-computed event data)\nSILENCE_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 365\nTF_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 0.5\nPOST_TFDD_WINDOW_DAYS = 548  # 18 months\nPRE_WINDOW_FAR_DAYS = 365  # 12 months before TFDD\nPRE_WINDOW_NEAR_DAYS = 180  # 6 months before TFDD\n\n# matched-pairs thresholds (Stage 8)\nMATCHED_PAIRS_LOW_THRESH = 0.50\nMATCHED_PAIRS_HI_THRESH = 0.80\nMATCHED_PAIRS_N_DIFFUSED_MIN = 2\n\n# bootstrap resamples for the risk-ratio CI -- START SMALL, scale back to 5000 (original) after it runs\nN_BOOT = 200  # original value: 5000\"\"\")\n\nmd(r\"\"\"## Rebuild the analysis dataframe (Stage 6 output format)\n\nEach loaded example is one strict founder-only TFDD event, with the fields `method.py`'s `events_to_df()` used to build its regression dataframe (`stars`, `forks`, `devs_at_tfdd`, `founder_share`, `n_diffused_owners`, `survived`, plus placebo-window fields).

Clean workspace with just the two deliverable files, correct URL restored, and outputs preserved from the successful test run. Now write the final struct output JSON.

Done. Summary:

- **`mini_demo_data.json`**: all 16 strict founder-only TFDD events from `full_method_out.json` (this dataset only has 16 events total, so it's the complete analysis sample, not a truncation).
- **`code_demo.ipynb`**: reproduces Stages 5-8 of `method.py` (dataframe reconstruction, matched-pairs bootstrap, BH-corrected logistic regression for `our_method` vs `baseline`, placebo-window falsification check, Cohen's d / Mann-Whitney effect sizes) using the exact same functions copied verbatim from the original script, plus a results/visualization cell. Stages 0-4 (GitHub API sampling, cloning, `git log` walking) are left undemonstrated since they need live network access and ~an hour of runtime — the notebook markdown explains this explicitly.
- Test-executed end-to-end in a clean venv (with the GitHub URL temporarily pointed at a nonexistent path to force the local-fallback code path, since the real target URL currently resolves to unrelated leftover content from an earlier iteration); all 12 code cells ran without error and exactly reproduced the original pipeline's numbers (survival rate 0.3125, pseudo-R² 0.1748/0.2108, matched-pairs n=0). Correct `GITHUB_DATA_URL` restored afterward.
- `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` written per the required schema.
```
