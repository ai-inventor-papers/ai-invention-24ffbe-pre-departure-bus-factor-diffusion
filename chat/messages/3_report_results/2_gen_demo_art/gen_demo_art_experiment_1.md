<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_I5KoOp16hub5`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_I5KoOp16hub5/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_I5KoOp16hub5/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_I5KoOp16hub5/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Does authority spreading before founders leave keep projects alive?
summary: >-
  Reimplemented Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) Degree-of-Authorship / Truck-Factor / Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD)
  pipeline end-to-end in method.py, run against the DATASET dependency's mined GitHub commit histories (15 usable repos with
  full per-file commit logs, out of 3427 raw records also containing an unrelated HuggingFace commit-message corpus that the
  loader correctly skips via a 'no_commits' filter). For each repo the pipeline: (1) resolves author aliases via normalized
  email/github-login matching and logs a per-repo alias-collapse-rate QA metric; (2) computes yearly cumulative-window DOA
  (Degree of Authorship) per file per author using Fritz et al.'s weights (FA=3.293, DL=1.098, AC=-1.017) as used by Avelino
  et al.; (3) derives the yearly greedy Truck-Factor set from primary DOA ownership; (4) detects Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure
  events (a TF-set fully silent for 12 months) and isolates founder-only TFDDs (TF=1 and the sole departing developer is the
  repo's first human committer, with bulk-import first commits filtered per the Kalliamvakou et al. 2014 'perils of mining
  GitHub' heuristic of >80% of files touched within the first week); (5) computes a NEW pre-departure authority-diffusion
  trajectory over the 6-12 months before each TFDD -- founder commit-share and count of distinct non-founder DOA file-owners
  -- alongside Avelino et al.'s original at-TFDD snapshot covariates (developers/commits/files at detachment); (6) classifies
  18-month post-TFDD survival into Avelino's four-level active/inactive grades (thriving/maintained/dormant/dead) plus a binary
  survived flag; (7) runs a matched-pairs bootstrap comparison (nearest-neighbor matching on standardized log-stars/log-forks/log-contributors
  within language, comparing high- vs low-diffusion projects) with 10,000-resample 95% CIs; (8) fits BH-corrected logistic
  and ordinal (statsmodels OrderedModel) regressions of survival on diffusion predictors plus snapshot covariates, reporting
  standardized effect sizes comparable to Avelino et al.'s reported d=0.13 (files) / 0.25-0.26 (developers, commits); (9)
  runs a 500-iteration placebo/window-shuffle check that redraws the pre-departure window from elsewhere in project history
  and refits the regression, to test whether the true diffusion-window effect exceeds the null distribution of effects from
  arbitrary windows. All steps implement both the proposed authority-diffusion predictor AND Avelino et al.'s original snapshot-covariate
  baseline side-by-side in the same regression and matched-pairs machinery, so the two are directly comparable under identical
  data and identical statistical procedures -- baseline_predict and ourmethod_predict columns are both emitted per example.
  The run found n_repos_total=3427 raw dataset records (3409 filtered as non-repo commit-message rows lacking file-level structure;
  the dataset dependency's GitHub API rate limiting -- 60 unauthenticated requests/hour -- constrained the usable repo count
  to 15, well below the plan's 150-250 target), yielding n_founder_tfdd_events=6, which falls below the ~40 events the plan's
  own fallback_plan identifies as needed for a well-powered matched-pairs test; per that fallback plan this limitation is
  reported explicitly in the output metadata (extended_sample_used_TFle2 flag, doa_approximation_used flag, alias_qa block)
  rather than silently presented as adequately powered, and all regression/matched-pairs/placebo numbers in method_out.json
  should be read as a small-n pilot demonstrating the pipeline mechanics rather than a well-powered test of the founder-diffusion-predicts-survival
  hypothesis. A bug where the dataset dependency's example-wrapper format (repo records JSON-encoded inside an 'input' string
  field, per the exp_gen_sol_out schema) was not being unwrapped -- causing every repo to be misread as having zero commits
  -- was found and fixed during this run; the corrected loader now parses that wrapper and the pipeline runs end-to-end in
  ~90 seconds. Output method_out.json / full_method_out.json / mini_method_out.json / preview_method_out.json validate cleanly
  against the exp_gen_sol_out.json schema (0 errors) and are all under 9KB, far below the 100MB size limit. Downstream users
  (GEN_PAPER_TEXT) should present this as a methodology-validation / small-sample pilot result: the pipeline itself (DOA/TF/TFDD
  replication, diffusion-trajectory measurement, survival classification, matched-pairs + regression + placebo statistical
  machinery) is fully implemented and tested (smoke tests on synthetic hand-constructed repos, mini-run sanity checks, and
  the full corpus run all pass), but the headline finding is data-starved (n=6 events) due to upstream GitHub API rate limiting
  documented in the DATASET dependency's own metadata, not a pipeline defect.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>
