**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_70BX2SQt9m6k`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_70BX2SQt9m6k/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: dataset
title: Founder Departure Survival Corpus
summary: >-
  This dataset artifact mines a unified corpus of founder-only Truck-Factor-Developer-Detachment (TFDD) events from public
  GitHub repositories, following the Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) and Truck Factor (TF) methodology verified in the dependency
  research artifact (Avelino et al. ICPC'16 / ESEM'19: DOA=3.293+1.098*FA+0.164*DL-0.321*ln(1+AC), DL=raw commit count; greedy
  TF algorithm; binary Active/Inactive survival state keyed to the last observed TFDD, no fixed post-window cutoff). Candidate
  discovery used the GitHub Search API stratified across 8 languages (JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, C++, Go, TypeScript)
  and 4 star-buckets, producing 2847 unique candidates; 524 were mined end-to-end (an initial 224-repo filtered batch plus
  a 300-repo second batch launched because the first batch undershot the target, per the plan's explicit failure-fallback
  step). Each candidate was cloned locally, its full commit history walked with a PyDriller-based per-file per-author FA/DL/AC
  extractor, DOA/TF recomputed yearly to locate the first TFDD event, and checked for: TF=1 at detachment (single founder,
  excluding TF>1 multi-core-dev projects), sufficient pre-TFDD history (6-12 months) to compute an authority-diffusion window,
  sufficient post-TFDD history to avoid severe right-censoring, and exclusion of non-software/migration-corrupted repos. This
  funnel yielded 62 qualifying repos (31 Active_survived / 31 Inactive_did_not_survive, an exactly balanced binary label),
  meeting the plan's 60-100+ target. Each output example's `input` field is a JSON string of covariates: founder commit share
  and count of distinct non-founder accounts reaching DOA-based primary file ownership in the 6-12 month pre-TFDD window,
  founder's early-authorship share, and TFDD-snapshot covariates (stars, forks, total contributors, language, license, project
  age, total commits, total files, history span). The `output` field is the binary survival label. Extensive per-repo metadata_*
  fields carry the full per-year DOA/TF tables, TFDD event details, founder identity, post-TFDD monthly commit series, and
  repo provenance so the downstream EXPERIMENT artifact can recompute alternate windows (e.g. for shuffle/placebo falsification
  checks) without re-mining or re-cloning any repository. Known inherited limitations, documented per the dependency artifact:
  the 6-12 month sub-year DOA window is a genuine unvalidated methodological extension (DOA/TF was only validated at yearly
  snapshots in the primary sources), and the local name/email identity-resolution heuristic (union-find merge, GitHub noreply
  numeric-ID special-casing, bot exclusion) is an unvalidated substitute for the original authors' GitHub-API-based alias
  resolution. The corpus skews heavily toward JavaScript (42/62 examples) with smaller counts in Ruby, C++, PHP, Java, TypeScript,
  Python, and Go, which downstream stratified analyses should account for. All code (search_candidates.py, mine_repo.py, run_mining.py,
  data.py) is included and reproducible via `uv run`, with intermediate candidate lists and per-repo mining results cached
  under temp/ to allow resuming without re-mining.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

ICPC\'16 / ESEM\'19) goes silent. For each mined repository it computes:\n\n- **DOA** (Degree of Authorship) per file per author: `DOA = 3.293 + 1.098*FirstAuthor + 0.164*Deliveries - 0.321*ln(1+Acceptances)`\n- **Truck Factor (TF)**: greedy removal of the highest-file-count DOA-primary author while remaining authors still cover ≥50% of files, recomputed yearly to locate the first TFDD event\n- Pre-TFDD covariates (6-12 month authority-diffusion window) and TFDD-snapshot covariates (stars, forks, contributors, language, etc.)\n- A binary survival label: whether the project was still active after the founder\'s departure (`Active_survived`) or not (`Inactive_did_not_survive`)\n\nThis demo notebook takes the **already-mined per-repo results** (the `temp/repo_results/*.json` files the full pipeline produces after cloning and walking each repo\'s commit history) and runs the exact same `data.py` assembly logic — filtering to qualifying repos, extracting predictor covariates, and building the final `input`/`output` schema — on a small curated subset. It ends with a summary table and a plot of the predictor/label relationship.'}

Success. Now let's restore the correct GITHUB_DATA_URL (removing the `.invalid` test patch) and verify.

Done. I built `code_demo.ipynb` (14 cells: setup, data loading with GitHub-URL/local-fallback pattern, config, `build_example` copied verbatim from `data.py`, the filtering/assembly logic mirroring `main()`, and a results table + scatter plot) alongside `mini_demo_data.json` (27 curated raw repo-mining records: 20 qualified repos balanced across survival labels, plus one example of each discard reason). Tested end-to-end in a clean venv via nbconvert — it executes without errors and produces the summary table and plot. The struct output file is written at `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`.
```
