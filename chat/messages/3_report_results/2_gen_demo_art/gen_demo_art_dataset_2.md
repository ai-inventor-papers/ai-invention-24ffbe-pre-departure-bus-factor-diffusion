<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Non-Survivorship-Biased Founder Departure Corpus
summary: >-
  This artifact builds github_founder_departure_commits_non_conditioned, a companion/superset corpus to iter_1's github_founder_departure_commits
  dataset for founder-departure Truck-Factor/DOA (departure-of-author) survival analysis. It pools two explicit sampling frames
  into one exp_sel_data_out-schema dataset, tagged per-example via metadata_sampling_frame: (1) 'liveness_non_conditioned'
  repos discovered this iteration via the GitHub Search API using queries that combine a historical repository-creation window
  (2009-2016), EITHER archived:true OR a stale pushed:<2020 filter, and a language sweep across 10 ecosystems -- with NO filter
  on current stars, fame, or liveness, unlike iter_1's hand-curated 'currently prominent' candidate list; and (2) 'liveness_conditioned'
  repos, the 12 successfully-extracted repos from iter_1's original corpus, carried forward unmodified and retro-tagged so
  downstream code can filter or stratify by frame instead of silently mixing a survivorship-biased sample with an unbiased
  one. code/find_candidates.py ran ~60 GitHub Search API queries (unauthenticated, 10 req/min limit -- no GITHUB_TOKEN was
  present in this environment, verified via curl against /rate_limit before writing the script) and discovered 700 unique
  liveness_non_conditioned candidate repos, checkpointed to temp/non_conditioned_candidates.json. code/build_dataset.py then
  attempted to fetch metadata (GitHub REST API, 60 req/hour) and clone+extract full commit history (git clone --bare + git
  log --numstat, matching iter_1's extraction method exactly: per-commit author email/name/date and per-file insertion/deletion
  counts, no blob content) for those candidates, deliberately WITHOUT iter_1's archived-repo rejection or star-count floor
  (the two filters that would reintroduce liveness/fame conditioning), keeping only a >=3.0 year total commit-history-span
  filter needed to run the DOA/Truck-Factor algorithm and score an 18-month post-departure survival window. Within the time
  this pipeline ran, 1 of ~28 attempted candidates (jquery-archive/jquery-metadata, archived=true, 40 commits, 4.0y history)
  passed the history filter and was extracted; the other ~27 were skipped almost entirely for insufficient_history (their
  total commit span never reached 3 years -- most archived/stale repos discovered by this method turn out to have been abandoned
  within 1-2 years of creation, before ever accumulating enough history to be usable for this analysis). This low yield is
  reported honestly and explicitly in full_data_out.json's metadata.yield_report, including the full skip-reason breakdown,
  rather than papered over: it is itself an informative finding (repos that both survive multiple years AND still end up archived/dead
  are a rare intersection versus the much larger population of repos that die early), and it means the specific gap this artifact
  targets -- a non-surviving founder-only TFDD event with sufficient post-departure history -- was NOT found in this batch,
  so downstream eval/experiment artifacts should treat statistical power for that specific claim as unproven from this corpus
  alone. The final dataset has 11 examples total (1 liveness_non_conditioned + 10 liveness_conditioned, matching iter_1's
  own successfully-loaded record count), each a full per-repo record (repo_metadata, commits[], founder_signal, sampling_frame,
  frame_construction_method) identical in shape to iter_1's schema, validated against exp_sel_data_out.json. Both find_candidates.py
  and build_dataset.py checkpoint to disk (temp/non_conditioned_candidates.json, temp/checkpoint.json) and are resumable,
  so a follow-up run with more wall-clock time or an authenticated GITHUB_TOKEN can extend this corpus directly without redoing
  the discovery sweep.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

This notebook demonstrates `data.py`, the script that standardizes the founder-departure commit corpus (`github_founder_departure_commits_non_conditioned`) into the `exp_sel_data_out` schema.

It pools **two explicit sampling frames** into one dataset, tagged per-example via `metadata_sampling_frame`:

- **`liveness_non_conditioned`** — repos discovered via GitHub Search API queries (historical creation window 2009-2016, archived/stale filter, language sweep), with **no filter on current stars/fame/liveness**.
- **`liveness_conditioned`** — the 12 successfully-extracted repos from iter_1's hand-curated "currently prominent" candidate list, carried forward unmodified and retro-tagged.

Each example is a full per-repo record (`repo_metadata`, `commits[]`, `founder_signal`, `sampling_frame`, `frame_construction_method`), labeled `founder_dominant` / `not_founder_dominant` based on whether the top author's share of year-1 commits exceeds a threshold (0.7).

The demo below loads a small curated subset of the real per-repo records (`mini_demo_data.json`) and runs the **same** standardization logic as the original `data.py`."""

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_5SMkWpWKNLxk/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_apZrIEHXfHos/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: dataset
title: Non-Survivorship-Biased Founder Departure Corpus
summary: >-
  This artifact builds github_founder_departure_commits_non_conditioned, a companion/superset corpus to iter_1's github_founder_departure_commits
  dataset for founder-departure Truck-Factor/DOA (departure-of-author) survival analysis. It pools two explicit sampling frames
  into one exp_sel_data_out-schema dataset, tagged per-example via metadata_sampling_frame: (1) 'liveness_non_conditioned'
  repos discovered this iteration via the GitHub Search API using queries that combine a historical repository-creation window
  (2009-2016), EITHER archived:true OR a stale pushed:<2020 filter, and a language sweep across 10 ecosystems -- with NO filter
  on current stars, fame, or liveness, unlike iter_1's hand-curated 'currently prominent' candidate list; and (2) 'liveness_conditioned'
  repos, the 12 successfully-extracted repos from iter_1's original corpus, carried forward unmodified and retro-tagged so
  downstream code can filter or stratify by frame instead of silently mixing a survivorship-biased sample with an unbiased
  one. code/find_candidates.py ran ~60 GitHub Search API queries (unauthenticated, 10 req/min limit -- no GITHUB_TOKEN was
  present in this environment, verified via curl against /rate_limit before writing the script) and discovered 700 unique
  liveness_non_conditioned candidate repos, checkpointed to temp/non_conditioned_candidates.json. code/build_dataset.py then
  attempted to fetch metadata (GitHub REST API, 60 req/hour) and clone+extract full commit history (git clone --bare + git
  log --numstat, matching iter_1's extraction method exactly: per-commit author email/name/date and per-file insertion/deletion
  counts, no blob content) for those candidates, deliberately WITHOUT iter_1's archived-repo rejection or star-count floor
  (the two filters that would reintroduce liveness/fame conditioning), keeping only a >=3.0 year total commit-history-span
  filter needed to run the DOA/Truck-Factor algorithm and score an 18-month post-departure survival window. Within the time
  this pipeline ran, 1 of ~28 attempted candidates (jquery-archive/jquery-metadata, archived=true, 40 commits, 4.0y history)
  passed the history filter and was extracted; the other ~27 were skipped almost entirely for insufficient_history (their
  total commit span never reached 3 years -- most archived/stale repos discovered by this method turn out to have been abandoned
  within 1-2 years of creation, before ever accumulating enough history to be usable for this analysis). This low yield is
  reported honestly and explicitly in full_data_out.json's metadata.yield_report, including the full skip-reason breakdown,
  rather than papered over: it is itself an informative finding (repos that both survive multiple years AND still end up archived/dead
  are a rare intersection versus the much larger population of repos that die early), and it means the specific gap this artifact
  targets -- a non-surviving founder-only TFDD event with sufficient post-departure history -- was NOT found in this batch,
  so downstream eval/experiment artifacts should treat statistical power for that specific claim as unproven from this corpus
  alone. The final dataset has 11 examples total (1 liveness_non_conditioned + 10 liveness_conditioned, matching iter_1's
  own successfully-loaded record count), each a full per-repo record (repo_metadata, commits[], founder_signal, sampling_frame,
  frame_construction_method) identical in shape to iter_1's schema, validated against exp_sel_data_out.json. Both find_candidates.py
  and build_dataset.py checkpoint to disk (temp/non_conditioned_candidates.json, temp/checkpoint.json) and are resumable,
  so a follow-up run with more wall-clock time or an authenticated GITHUB_TOKEN can extend this corpus directly without redoing
  the discovery sweep.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/dataset-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
