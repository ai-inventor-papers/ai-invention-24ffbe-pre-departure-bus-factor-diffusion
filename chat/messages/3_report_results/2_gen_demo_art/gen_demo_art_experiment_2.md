**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_65c2e4aGIhui`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_65c2e4aGIhui/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: experiment
title: Re-Testing Founder-Departure Survival Signals
summary: >-
  This experiment re-runs three pre-registered statistical tests (BH-FDR logistic regression, caliper matched-pairs bootstrap,
  within-repo year-level placebo) plus a new window-boundary-noise control on the single unified 32-repo founder-departure
  Truck-Factor corpus (art_24Q1bYB_ULpu), replacing the prior iteration's independently re-mined, partially-overlapping data.
  Corpus provenance is hard-validated at load time (exact n=32, 20 survived/12 not, language breakdown Go7/Ruby11/JS6/Java5/Rust3)
  against the dataset artifact's own summary before any analysis runs. Test 0 replicates Avelino et al.'s baseline: 62.5%
  survival rate and negligible-to-small Cohen's d (0.14-0.49) for developer/commit/file/star/fork gaps between survivors and
  non-survivors, consistent with the source literature. Test A fits a BH-FDR-corrected logistic regression of survival on
  the diffusion predictors plus stars/forks/contributors/age/commits/files/history-span/language controls; it pre-detects
  complete/quasi-complete separation (the Java and Rust language dummies perfectly predict the outcome in this small corpus)
  and falls back to L2-regularized logistic regression with a 300-resample bootstrap for p-values rather than letting statsmodels'
  unregularized MLE diverge/hang, which is what crashed the prior execution attempt. Test B sweeps three caliper widths for
  nearest-neighbor matched pairs on standardized [log(stars), log(forks), log(contributors)] and reports the result honestly
  as EXECUTED or UNTESTABLE depending on achieved pair count, never fabricating a bootstrap CI from zero pairs. Test C raises
  the prior iteration's 25 placebo draws to 300 per repo, using a documented year-resolution proxy statistic (year-over-year
  change in n_active_authors_in_doa) in place of the plan's arbitrary sub-year re-slicing, because the dataset artifact's
  metadata carries only yearly DOA/TF snapshots, not per-commit timestamps -- this substitution is stated explicitly in every
  relevant output field, per the fallback_plan. A new Sec-6 boundary-noise control computes founder-share variance across
  multiple stable (non-departure) windows within each repo's own history, substituting TFDD-corpus repos' own multi-year-before-departure
  periods for the unavailable non-TFDD candidate pool, and compares this noise floor against the true window's effect size
  to test whether the weak prior-iteration signal (r=0.180, p=0.615, n=30) could be a window-computation artifact rather than
  a real absence of a mechanism. A critical, explicitly logged data-quality finding: founder_commit_share_pre_tfdd -- the
  plan's primary diffusion predictor -- is constant (0.0) for 31 of 32 rows and missing for the remaining row in this specific
  dataset artifact (verified against the raw input JSON, not a parsing bug here), making it mathematically inestimable in
  a regression and undefined for point-biserial correlation; every test detects this and excludes/flags it explicitly rather
  than silently crashing or fabricating a value, and n_distinct_new_primary_owners_pre_tfdd is used as the sole viable diffusion
  predictor throughout. All four analyses (baseline, Test A/B/C, Sec 6) execute successfully end-to-end in about 13 seconds,
  write a schema-validated (exp_gen_sol_out) method_out.json with per-repo predict_baseline (controls-only model) and predict_our_method
  (full model) columns, RLIMIT_AS (16GB) and RLIMIT_CPU (600s) hard caps guard against the runaway-computation container crash
  observed in the previous execution attempt, and a fixed RNG seed (20260821) makes every bootstrap/placebo draw reproducible.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Full dataset is only 178KB / 32 repos, and the whole script runs in ~13s — so I'll use the full corpus as the demo data (it's already minimal). All required hard-coded validation checks (n=32, exact language counts) depend on having the complete corpus, so no subsetting is possible without breaking the script's own checks.

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

title: Re-Testing Founder-Departure Survival Signals
summary: >-
  This experiment re-runs three pre-registered statistical tests (BH-FDR logistic regression, caliper matched-pairs bootstrap,
  within-repo year-level placebo) plus a new window-boundary-noise control on the single unified 32-repo founder-departure
  Truck-Factor corpus (art_24Q1bYB_ULpu), replacing the prior iteration's independently re-mined, partially-overlapping data.
  Corpus provenance is hard-validated at load time (exact n=32, 20 survived/12 not, language breakdown Go7/Ruby11/JS6/Java5/Rust3)
  against the dataset artifact's own summary before any analysis runs. Test 0 replicates Avelino et al.'s baseline: 62.5%
  survival rate and negligible-to-small Cohen's d (0.14-0.49) for developer/commit/file/star/fork gaps between survivors and
  non-survivors, consistent with the source literature. Test A fits a BH-FDR-corrected logistic regression of survival on
  the diffusion predictors plus stars/forks/contributors/age/commits/files/history-span/language controls; it pre-detects
  complete/quasi-complete separation (the Java and Rust language dummies perfectly predict the outcome in this small corpus)
  and falls back to L2-regularized logistic regression with a 300-resample bootstrap for p-values rather than letting statsmodels'
  unregularized MLE diverge/hang, which is what crashed the prior execution attempt. Test B sweeps three caliper widths for
  nearest-neighbor matched pairs on standardized [log(stars), log(forks), log(contributors)] and reports the result honestly
  as EXECUTED or UNTESTABLE depending on achieved pair count, never fabricating a bootstrap CI from zero pairs. Test C raises
  the prior iteration's 25 placebo draws to 300 per repo, using a documented year-resolution proxy statistic (year-over-year
  change in n_active_authors_in_doa) in place of the plan's arbitrary sub-year re-slicing, because the dataset artifact's
  metadata carries only yearly DOA/TF snapshots, not per-commit timestamps -- this substitution is stated explicitly in every
  relevant output field, per the fallback_plan. A new Sec-6 boundary-noise control computes founder-share variance across
  multiple stable (non-departure) windows within each repo's own history, substituting TFDD-corpus repos' own multi-year-before-departure
  periods for the unavailable non-TFDD candidate pool, and compares this noise floor against the true window's effect size
  to test whether the weak prior-iteration signal (r=0.180, p=0.615, n=30) could be a window-computation artifact rather than
  a real absence of a mechanism. A critical, explicitly logged data-quality finding: founder_commit_share_pre_tfdd -- the
  plan's primary diffusion predictor -- is constant (0.0) for 31 of 32 rows and missing for the remaining row in this specific
  dataset artifact (verified against the raw input JSON, not a parsing bug here), making it mathematically inestimable in
  a regression and undefined for point-biserial correlation; every test detects this and excludes/flags it explicitly rather
  than silently crashing or fabricating a value, and n_distinct_new_primary_owners_pre_tfdd is used as the sole viable diffusion
  predictor throughout. All four analyses (baseline, Test A/B/C, Sec 6) execute successfully end-to-end in about 13 seconds,
  write a schema-validated (exp_gen_sol_out) method_out.json with per-repo predict_baseline (controls-only model) and predict_our_method
  (full model) columns, RLIMIT_AS (16GB) and RLIMIT_CPU (600s) hard caps guard against the runaway-computation container crash
  observed in the previous execution attempt, and a fixed RNG seed (20260821) makes every bootstrap/placebo draw reproducible.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Everything checks out: the notebook exists, executed with 0 errors, and uses the exact required GITHUB_DATA_URL with local fallback. Now write the struct output file.

The demo notebook was already built and verified in this workspace (24 cells, 0 execution errors, correct GitHub URL with local fallback pattern). I confirmed the executed output is error-free and wrote the required `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` pointing to `code_demo.ipynb` and `mini_demo_data.json`. Task complete.
