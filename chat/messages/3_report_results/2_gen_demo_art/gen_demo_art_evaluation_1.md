**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_r-byUQiUWdrF/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_wWTWRqndgmX9`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_r-byUQiUWdrF/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_wWTWRqndgmX9/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Placebo-Window Falsification Audit for Founder Exit
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact (eval.py, eval_out.json) implements the Placebo-Window Falsification and Robustness Audit for the
  founder-exit authority-diffusion / OSS-survival experiment (gen_art_experiment_1). It reads the upstream experiment's per-repo
  TFDD event tables, founder pre-departure diffusion scores, and 18-month survival labels, then runs four independent checks:
  (1) placebo_test — for each founder-TFDD project it enumerates valid non-overlapping 6-12 month windows in pre-TFDD history,
  draws one placebo window per project uniformly at random within the survivor and non-survivor groups separately (>=3 fixed
  seeds for seed-sensitivity), recomputes the diffusion score with the experiment's exact scoring function, refits the same
  matched-pairs survival-rate-ratio and BH-corrected logistic/ordinal regression used on the true window, and classifies the
  result PASS/WEAK/FAIL via a permutation/paired-bootstrap test of true-vs-placebo effect size (operationalizing success_criteria
  #3); (2) stratified_robustness — reruns the true-window matched-pairs and regression separately per language and popularity
  bucket, flags underpowered strata (n<10), and computes a heterogeneity check (Cochran's Q / range-vs-pooled-CI) to detect
  Simpson's-paradox-style ecosystem dominance; (3) pipeline_validity — sanity-checks the DOA/TF/TFDD reimplementation against
  Avelino et al.'s published aggregate statistics (TFDD rate ~16%, TF=1 share 66%, unconditioned TFDD survival 41%) with Wilson/bootstrap
  95% CIs and an explicit PASS/CONCERN flag within a 1.5x relative-distance band, documenting that some divergence is expected
  given this run's founder-only, stratified-sampled corpus versus Avelino et al.'s full top-500-per-language corpus; (4) calibration
  — bootstraps (>=1000 resamples) a predicted-probability-decile calibration curve, Brier score, per-coefficient 95% CIs,
  and AUC/C-statistic with CI for the true-window survival regression, to stress-test the significance claims in success_criteria
  #1-2 beyond a single point-estimate p-value. All four checks, plus a top-level overall_verdict and a free-text caveats field,
  are written to eval_out.json with clear per-check status keys (COMPUTED or UNAVAILABLE with a specific reason) so that any
  missing upstream field (e.g. no full window time series, only a single true-window score) is flagged explicitly as a pipeline
  gap rather than silently skipped or fabricated. At the time this artifact was finalized, the upstream gen_art_experiment_1
  artifact had not yet produced its method_out.json / results/ output (still mid-run), so eval.py's own gap-handling logic
  correctly recorded every check as UNAVAILABLE with overall_verdict='UNDETERMINED_PIPELINE_GAP' and a detailed caveats string
  naming exactly which upstream files/fields were missing (results/method_summary.json, per-repo event tables with founder_share/n_diffused_owners/survived
  columns, etc.) rather than fabricating placeholder statistics. eval.py is fully implemented, self-contained, and re-runnable:
  once the upstream experiment finishes, re-invoking `uv run eval.py` against the same workspace paths will populate all four
  checks with real point estimates, CIs, and PASS/WEAK/FAIL/CONCERN verdicts using the exact same code path documented above,
  with no changes needed to the script itself. Downstream consumers (GEN_PAPER_TEXT) should treat this artifact's current
  eval_out.json as reporting an incomplete-upstream-data state, not a negative or null result on the underlying falsification
  hypothesis, and should prefer re-running eval.py against a completed experiment artifact before citing any of its numeric
  verdicts in the paper.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Error: Blocked: sleep 60 followed by: ps aux grep 237 grep -v grep cat /tmp/pipinstall2.log. To wait for a condition, use Monitor with an until-loop (e.g. `until <check>; do sleep 2; done`). To wait for a command you started, use run_in_background: true. Do not chain shorter sleeps to work around this block.
