<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_IN6RRoJnrq1j`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fvTNuFE3-z80/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_IN6RRoJnrq1j/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: evaluation
title: Bootstrap CIs and Identity Spot-Check
summary: >-
  This evaluation artifact adds statistical rigor to the founder-exit/repo-survival experiment (art_eXxdnfS0o6aV). It loads
  full_method_out.json (62 curated repos, 47 passing prefilters, 30 forming the founder-only-TFDD analysis corpus, 11 survivors
  vs 19 non-survivors) and runs four analyses. STEP 1: nonparametric bootstrap (B=10,000, seeded) 95% CIs on Cohen's d for
  three of the five snapshot covariates (developers_at_tfdd, commits_at_tfdd, files_at_tfdd) where raw per-repo survivor/non-survivor
  arrays were reconstructable from the examples records; stars and forks are marked NOT_COMPUTABLE_FROM_ARTIFACT because their
  raw per-repo values were never persisted to method_out.json. Each covariate's bootstrap CI is compared against Avelino et
  al.'s (ESEM 2019) reference range (d=0.13-0.26); developers_at_tfdd's CI [-1.05, 0.53] contains the Avelino range, while
  commits and files CIs exclude it. STEP 2: attempted a bootstrap CI on the placebo test's empirical percentile (reported
  point estimate: 40th percentile, p=0.615, n=25 null draws vs the pre-registered target of 200) but found only the four pooled
  scalar summary statistics were persisted, not the underlying per-repo/per-draw null values, so a true bootstrap CI is NOT_RECONSTRUCTABLE_FROM_ARTIFACT
  -- reported as a concrete, named gap for the next experiment iteration (persist raw null-draw arrays). STEP 3: a deterministic
  (numpy RandomState(42)) 12-repo manual GitHub spot-check of the identity/alias-resolution heuristic, using unauthenticated
  web fetches of GitHub commit-history and profile pages (with an AMBIGUOUS-and-swap fallback when a fetch is blocked/rate-limited/404s)
  -- final clean run found n_pass=11, n_alias_merge_error=1, n_ambiguous=0, observed error rate 0.083 with Wilson 95% CI [0.015,
  0.354]; the one detected error is documented with its specific nature and an explicit judgment on whether it would plausibly
  change founder identification or TF=1 status for that repo's event. STEP 4: consolidates all three original pre-registered
  success criteria into a TESTED_NULL / TESTED_LOW_RESOLUTION / UNTESTABLE_AT_SCALE reclassification driven by whether the
  Step 1/2 CIs are narrow enough to rule out a real small-to-moderate effect, with the practical implication for a future
  larger-corpus iteration stated per criterion. Output is eval_out.json (validated against the exp_eval_sol_out schema) with
  metadata carrying corpus_stats, covariate_ci_table, placebo_ci, identity_spotcheck_results, and success_criteria_reclassification,
  plus per-example entries echoing the original experiment's predict_our_method/predict_baseline_snapshot fields unchanged.
  Full/mini/preview JSON variants were generated and all bootstrap/spot-check gaps are stated explicitly in plain language
  rather than silently omitted.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Done. Summary:

- **`mini_demo_data.json`** — the full upstream `full_method_out.json` (62 repos, 64KB, already ≤100 examples), used as-is since it's small.
- **`code_demo.ipynb`** — cell-split version of `eval.py` with markdown explanations before each step (Step 0 parse, Step 1 bootstrap Cohen's d CIs, Step 2 placebo-CI gap, Step 3 live GitHub identity spot-check, Step 4 criteria reclassification), a config cell (`B_BOOTSTRAP=200`, `N_SPOTCHECK=4`, both reduced from originals of 10,000/12 with the originals noted in comments), and a results cell with a printed summary table + a Cohen's-d forest plot vs. the Avelino reference range.
- Verified end-to-end in a clean venv (nbconvert execute, ~4s runtime, well under the 600s budget) — all cells pass, including live unauthenticated GitHub API calls.
- Confirmed `GITHUB_DATA_URL` is set exactly as specified with the local-file fallback pattern.
