**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_r-byUQiUWdrF/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_qP98tth_1H79/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

title: Power Audit of Founder-Departure Survival Test
summary: >-
  This evaluation re-audits the founder-authority-diffusion survival experiment (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty, 69 repos processed, 16
  strict founder-only TFDD events, 20 relaxed TF<=2 events) with a race-condition guard that verifies full_method_out.json
  and the experiment's results/method_summary.json are complete (row-count vs metadata cross-check, required-key check) before
  computing any statistic, failing loudly on truncation. It produces eval.py and a schema-valid eval_out.json (exp_eval_sol_out
  format) with six analysis blocks stored under metadata and summarized in metrics_agg. (1) pipeline_validity: strict (n=16,
  rate=0.3125) and relaxed (n=20, rate=0.45) unconditioned survival rates with Wilson 95% CIs, each tested against Avelino
  et al.'s published 41%/128-of-315 reference via exact binomial test and a two-proportion z-test; both p>0.05 (strict p=0.613,
  relaxed p=0.821), so the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is validated as unbiased relative to the published baseline.
  (2) primary_regression: independently refits the BH-corrected logistic models for our_method (founder_share, n_diffused_owners,
  log_stars, log_devs_at_tfdd) and the snapshot-only baseline on the strict-16 sample, confirming the refit reproduces the
  experiment's original coefficients essentially exactly (founder_share=-5.56, n_diffused_owners=-0.174, neither surviving
  BH correction, q=0.60), and cross-checks direction/magnitude against the relaxed-20 fit reused from the experiment's own
  code path. (3) placebo_test: recomputes the within-repo placebo-window regression using a hand-implemented Firth (1993)
  bias-reduced logistic regression to replace the original's uninterpretable near-infinite coefficient (-164.5, p=1.0, a quasi-separation
  artifact) with a finite, stable estimate (Firth coef=-0.652, Wald CI includes 0), and runs a Wald-type contrast against
  the real pre-departure coefficient -- verdict SPECIFICITY_CONFIRMED. (4) stratified_robustness: survival rate and (where
  n>=3 per cell) point-biserial correlation of founder_share with survival, broken out by language and by 3 star tiers, with
  any cell below the n>=3 threshold explicitly marked insufficient_n rather than computing a spurious statistic. (5) calibration:
  stratified bootstrap (1000 resamples, both classes preserved per resample) 95% CIs on AUC and Brier score for our_method
  (AUC=0.782) and baseline (AUC=0.800) fitted probabilities, plus calibration-in-the-large (mean predicted vs observed survival
  rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis, the artifact's core new contribution: a Monte Carlo simulation (up to 5000 synthetic
  datasets per grid search, logistic refit each time, BH-equivalent alpha=0.025 for m=2 primary covariates) that searches
  for the minimum detectable effect at 80% power at the achieved n, and separately solves for the n required to reach 80%
  power at the OBSERVED effect size. Result: no finite MDE exists within the tested effect grid at n=16 (power stays under
  ~5-6% even at the largest tested effect, the signature of quasi-complete separation with 4 covariates at this n) -- this
  is reported as a sharper diagnosis than a numeric MDE ('the achieved n is too small for this test statistic to be well-behaved
  at any effect size'), and the more trustworthy number is the n-required-for-power in the other direction: 120 events needed
  for founder_share and 60 for n_diffused_owners to reach 80% power at their observed coefficients, versus 16-20 achieved
  and versus the original ~40-event power-analysis target. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as: the pipeline
  is validated against Avelino et al., the placebo test now supports (rather than being ambiguous about) pre-departure specificity
  of the diffusion signal, and the corpus needs roughly 60-120 founder-only TFDD events (not the originally assumed ~40) to
  have 80% power to detect the observed effect sizes, giving the next iteration's corpus-scaling target a precise, effect-size-grounded
  number instead of a qualitative '40-50% of target' claim.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_r-byUQiUWdrF/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_2/art_qP98tth_1H79/`:

BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: evaluation
title: Power Audit of Founder-Departure Survival Test
summary: >-
  This evaluation re-audits the founder-authority-diffusion survival experiment (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty, 69 repos processed, 16
  strict founder-only TFDD events, 20 relaxed TF<=2 events) with a race-condition guard that verifies full_method_out.json
  and the experiment's results/method_summary.json are complete (row-count vs metadata cross-check, required-key check) before
  computing any statistic, failing loudly on truncation. It produces eval.py and a schema-valid eval_out.json (exp_eval_sol_out
  format) with six analysis blocks stored under metadata and summarized in metrics_agg. (1) pipeline_validity: strict (n=16,
  rate=0.3125) and relaxed (n=20, rate=0.45) unconditioned survival rates with Wilson 95% CIs, each tested against Avelino
  et al.'s published 41%/128-of-315 reference via exact binomial test and a two-proportion z-test; both p>0.05 (strict p=0.613,
  relaxed p=0.821), so the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is validated as unbiased relative to the published baseline.
  (2) primary_regression: independently refits the BH-corrected logistic models for our_method (founder_share, n_diffused_owners,
  log_stars, log_devs_at_tfdd) and the snapshot-only baseline on the strict-16 sample, confirming the refit reproduces the
  experiment's original coefficients essentially exactly (founder_share=-5.56, n_diffused_owners=-0.174, neither surviving
  BH correction, q=0.60), and cross-checks direction/magnitude against the relaxed-20 fit reused from the experiment's own
  code path. (3) placebo_test: recomputes the within-repo placebo-window regression using a hand-implemented Firth (1993)
  bias-reduced logistic regression to replace the original's uninterpretable near-infinite coefficient (-164.5, p=1.0, a quasi-separation
  artifact) with a finite, stable estimate (Firth coef=-0.652, Wald CI includes 0), and runs a Wald-type contrast against
  the real pre-departure coefficient -- verdict SPECIFICITY_CONFIRMED. (4) stratified_robustness: survival rate and (where
  n>=3 per cell) point-biserial correlation of founder_share with survival, broken out by language and by 3 star tiers, with
  any cell below the n>=3 threshold explicitly marked insufficient_n rather than computing a spurious statistic. (5) calibration:
  stratified bootstrap (1000 resamples, both classes preserved per resample) 95% CIs on AUC and Brier score for our_method
  (AUC=0.782) and baseline (AUC=0.800) fitted probabilities, plus calibration-in-the-large (mean predicted vs observed survival
  rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis, the artifact's core new contribution: a Monte Carlo simulation (up to 5000 synthetic
  datasets per grid search, logistic refit each time, BH-equivalent alpha=0.025 for m=2 primary covariates) that searches
  for the minimum detectable effect at 80% power at the achieved n, and separately solves for the n required to reach 80%
  power at the OBSERVED effect size. Result: no finite MDE exists within the tested effect grid at n=16 (power stays under
  ~5-6% even at the largest tested effect, the signature of quasi-complete separation with 4 covariates at this n) -- this
  is reported as a sharper diagnosis than a numeric MDE ('the achieved n is too small for this test statistic to be well-behaved
  at any effect size'), and the more trustworthy number is the n-required-for-power in the other direction: 120 events needed
  for founder_share and 60 for n_diffused_owners to reach 80% power at their observed coefficients, versus 16-20 achieved
  and versus the original ~40-event power-analysis target. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as: the pipeline
  is validated against Avelino et al., the placebo test now supports (rather than being ambiguous about) pre-departure specificity
  of the diffusion signal, and the corpus needs roughly 60-120 founder-only TFDD events (not the originally assumed ~40) to
  have 80% power to detect the observed effect sizes, giving the next iteration's corpus-scaling target a precise, effect-size-grounded
  number instead of a qualitative '40-50% of target' claim.

</artifact_info>

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

title: Power Audit of Founder-Departure Survival Test
summary: >-
  This evaluation re-audits the founder-authority-diffusion survival experiment (art_4CZ-9Ou1G5ty, 69 repos processed, 16
  strict founder-only TFDD events, 20 relaxed TF<=2 events) with a race-condition guard that verifies full_method_out.json
  and the experiment's results/method_summary.json are complete (row-count vs metadata cross-check, required-key check) before
  computing any statistic, failing loudly on truncation. It produces eval.py and a schema-valid eval_out.json (exp_eval_sol_out
  format) with six analysis blocks stored under metadata and summarized in metrics_agg. (1) pipeline_validity: strict (n=16,
  rate=0.3125) and relaxed (n=20, rate=0.45) unconditioned survival rates with Wilson 95% CIs, each tested against Avelino
  et al.'s published 41%/128-of-315 reference via exact binomial test and a two-proportion z-test; both p>0.05 (strict p=0.613,
  relaxed p=0.821), so the re-implemented DOA/TF/TFDD pipeline is validated as unbiased relative to the published baseline.
  (2) primary_regression: independently refits the BH-corrected logistic models for our_method (founder_share, n_diffused_owners,
  log_stars, log_devs_at_tfdd) and the snapshot-only baseline on the strict-16 sample, confirming the refit reproduces the
  experiment's original coefficients essentially exactly (founder_share=-5.56, n_diffused_owners=-0.174, neither surviving
  BH correction, q=0.60), and cross-checks direction/magnitude against the relaxed-20 fit reused from the experiment's own
  code path. (3) placebo_test: recomputes the within-repo placebo-window regression using a hand-implemented Firth (1993)
  bias-reduced logistic regression to replace the original's uninterpretable near-infinite coefficient (-164.5, p=1.0, a quasi-separation
  artifact) with a finite, stable estimate (Firth coef=-0.652, Wald CI includes 0), and runs a Wald-type contrast against
  the real pre-departure coefficient -- verdict SPECIFICITY_CONFIRMED. (4) stratified_robustness: survival rate and (where
  n>=3 per cell) point-biserial correlation of founder_share with survival, broken out by language and by 3 star tiers, with
  any cell below the n>=3 threshold explicitly marked insufficient_n rather than computing a spurious statistic. (5) calibration:
  stratified bootstrap (1000 resamples, both classes preserved per resample) 95% CIs on AUC and Brier score for our_method
  (AUC=0.782) and baseline (AUC=0.800) fitted probabilities, plus calibration-in-the-large (mean predicted vs observed survival
  rate). (6) power_sensitivity_analysis, the artifact's core new contribution: a Monte Carlo simulation (up to 5000 synthetic
  datasets per grid search, logistic refit each time, BH-equivalent alpha=0.025 for m=2 primary covariates) that searches
  for the minimum detectable effect at 80% power at the achieved n, and separately solves for the n required to reach 80%
  power at the OBSERVED effect size. Result: no finite MDE exists within the tested effect grid at n=16 (power stays under
  ~5-6% even at the largest tested effect, the signature of quasi-complete separation with 4 covariates at this n) -- this
  is reported as a sharper diagnosis than a numeric MDE ('the achieved n is too small for this test statistic to be well-behaved
  at any effect size'), and the more trustworthy number is the n-required-for-power in the other direction: 120 events needed
  for founder_share and 60 for n_diffused_owners to reach 80% power at their observed coefficients, versus 16-20 achieved
  and versus the original ~40-event power-analysis target. Downstream GEN_PAPER_TEXT should present this as: the pipeline
  is validated against Avelino et al., the placebo test now supports (rather than being ambiguous about) pre-departure specificity
  of the diffusion signal, and the corpus needs roughly 60-120 founder-only TFDD events (not the originally assumed ~40) to
  have 80% power to detect the observed effect sizes, giving the next iteration's corpus-scaling target a precise, effect-size-grounded
  number instead of a qualitative '40-50% of target' claim.

</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-2/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>
