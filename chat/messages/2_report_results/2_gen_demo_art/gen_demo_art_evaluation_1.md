<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: evaluation
title: Calibrating and Stress-Testing the Founder-Departure Diffusion Result
summary: >-
  Two-stage evaluation of the founder-authority-diffusion-vs-survival experiment. Stage A (calibration gate) recomputes Avelino
  et al. (ESEM 2019)'s three headline aggregate statistics -- Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD) incidence rate, share
  of TFDDs at TF=1, and overall 18-month survival rate -- over the 15-repo dataset dependency's raw commit event log, with
  95% Wilson CIs and PASS/FLAG_DEVIATION status per check, plus a snapshot-null Cohen's d replication and a 4-step diagnostic
  protocol (strata composition, abandoner-threshold parameter, hand-traced DOA sanity check, alias-collapse-rate spot check)
  that runs automatically whenever any check is flagged. Stage B runs five robustness/confound-freedom checks against the
  main experiment's founder-only-TFDD diffusion-vs-survival finding: (6) window-boundary sensitivity across a near/far/end-offset
  grid with BH-corrected logistic-regression p-values per variant and a sign-stability verdict; (7) founder-identification-heuristic
  sensitivity (first-commit author vs first-calendar-year plurality vs highest-lifetime-DOA) with a disagreement rate; (8)
  an age-at-TFDD confound check comparing diffusion-coefficient sign/significance before and after adding repo age as a covariate,
  plus VIF and a founder-share-vs-age correlation; (9) matched-pairs bucket-definition sensitivity (quartile vs log-scale
  star bins) with bootstrap CIs on the survival lift; and (10) an explicit permutation test (random relocation of the pre-departure
  window within project history) yielding a two-sided permutation p-value, split by eventual survivors vs non-survivors. All
  rate/effect-size outputs carry 95% CIs (Wilson for proportions, >=1000-resample bootstrap otherwise) and multi-test families
  are BH-adjusted. The three hypothesis success criteria are re-scored PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with exact numeric evidence, and
  an overall verdict integrates the Stage A gate with the Stage B evidence. On this run: n_corpus=15, Stage A gate=FLAG_DEVIATION
  (small opportunistic sample vs Avelino's 1932-repo stratified corpus, so CIs are wide but still miss two of three reference
  rates), n_founder_tfdd_events=5 (severely underpowered for regression/permutation inference), and overall verdict=DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_PIPELINE_UNCALIBRATED
  -- the evaluation's central, actionable finding is that the pipeline needs a substantially larger corpus before its diffusion-vs-survival
  claim can be trusted, not that the effect itself is false. A prior execution attempt crashed the container because check10's
  permutation test called the O(n_commits) DOA-recomputation routine ~5000 times (bundles x 1000 permutations) with no caching,
  which this run fixed by hard-capping permutations to 60/40 draws -- eval.py now completes end-to-end in ~165s. Downstream
  artifacts should read eval_out.json's stage_a_calibration.gate_status and stage_b_robustness fields, and treat the power_caveat
  field in final_scoring as load-bearing given n_founder_tfdd_events=5.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Good, real per-file commit data. Now let's view `load_repo_commits`, `compute_doa_owner_per_file`, `truck_factor_set`, `classify_survival`, `_year_ends`, `_first_commit_author` in full to embed inline in the notebook.

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_LYICROwXFVjo/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_1/art_JvYoV94jgkuB/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<task>
Convert this artifact's Python script into a demo notebook with MINIMAL changes to the original code.
Split into cells, add markdown explanations between sections, add a visualization cell at the end.
Output: mini_demo_data.json + code_demo.ipynb (notebook that loads data from GitHub URL)

type: evaluation
title: Calibrating and Stress-Testing the Founder-Departure Diffusion Result
summary: >-
  Two-stage evaluation of the founder-authority-diffusion-vs-survival experiment. Stage A (calibration gate) recomputes Avelino
  et al. (ESEM 2019)'s three headline aggregate statistics -- Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD) incidence rate, share
  of TFDDs at TF=1, and overall 18-month survival rate -- over the 15-repo dataset dependency's raw commit event log, with
  95% Wilson CIs and PASS/FLAG_DEVIATION status per check, plus a snapshot-null Cohen's d replication and a 4-step diagnostic
  protocol (strata composition, abandoner-threshold parameter, hand-traced DOA sanity check, alias-collapse-rate spot check)
  that runs automatically whenever any check is flagged. Stage B runs five robustness/confound-freedom checks against the
  main experiment's founder-only-TFDD diffusion-vs-survival finding: (6) window-boundary sensitivity across a near/far/end-offset
  grid with BH-corrected logistic-regression p-values per variant and a sign-stability verdict; (7) founder-identification-heuristic
  sensitivity (first-commit author vs first-calendar-year plurality vs highest-lifetime-DOA) with a disagreement rate; (8)
  an age-at-TFDD confound check comparing diffusion-coefficient sign/significance before and after adding repo age as a covariate,
  plus VIF and a founder-share-vs-age correlation; (9) matched-pairs bucket-definition sensitivity (quartile vs log-scale
  star bins) with bootstrap CIs on the survival lift; and (10) an explicit permutation test (random relocation of the pre-departure
  window within project history) yielding a two-sided permutation p-value, split by eventual survivors vs non-survivors. All
  rate/effect-size outputs carry 95% CIs (Wilson for proportions, >=1000-resample bootstrap otherwise) and multi-test families
  are BH-adjusted. The three hypothesis success criteria are re-scored PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with exact numeric evidence, and
  an overall verdict integrates the Stage A gate with the Stage B evidence. On this run: n_corpus=15, Stage A gate=FLAG_DEVIATION
  (small opportunistic sample vs Avelino's 1932-repo stratified corpus, so CIs are wide but still miss two of three reference
  rates), n_founder_tfdd_events=5 (severely underpowered for regression/permutation inference), and overall verdict=DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_PIPELINE_UNCALIBRATED
  -- the evaluation's central, actionable finding is that the pipeline needs a substantially larger corpus before its diffusion-vs-survival
  claim can be trusted, not that the effect itself is false. A prior execution attempt crashed the container because check10's
  permutation test called the O(n_commits) DOA-recomputation routine ~5000 times (bundles x 1000 permutations) with no caching,
  which this run fixed by hard-capping permutations to 60/40 draws -- eval.py now completes end-to-end in ~165s. Downstream
  artifacts should read eval_out.json's stage_a_calibration.gate_status and stage_b_robustness fields, and treat the power_caveat
  field in final_scoring as load-bearing given n_founder_tfdd_events=5.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

(ESEM 2019) — TFDD incidence rate, share of TFDDs at Truck-Factor=1 (single-person bottleneck), and overall 18-month survival rate — each with a 95% Wilson confidence interval and a PASS / FLAG_DEVIATION verdict. If any check is flagged, a 4-step diagnostic protocol (sample-strata composition, abandoner-threshold parameter, a hand-traced DOA sanity check, and an alias-collapse-rate spot check) runs automatically.\n- **Stage B (robustness / confound checks):** five checks on the founder-only-TFDD diffusion-vs-survival result — (6) window-boundary sensitivity, (7) founder-identification-heuristic sensitivity, (8) an age-at-TFDD confound check, (9) matched-pairs bucket-definition sensitivity, and (10) a permutation (placebo) test that randomly relocates the pre-departure window within project history.\n\nAll rate/effect-size outputs carry 95% CIs (Wilson for proportions, bootstrap otherwise), multi-test families are BH-adjusted, and the three hypothesis success criteria are re-scored PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with exact numeric evidence, folded into an overall verdict.\n\nThis demo runs the same logic as `eval.py` (and the small slice of `method.py` it re-uses for DOA / Truck-Factor / TFDD computation) over a **mini subset of 3 real GitHub repositories** so it finishes in well under a minute — the original run used a 15-repo corpus and took ~165s.'}

<conversion_philosophy>
**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

type: evaluation
title: Calibrating and Stress-Testing the Founder-Departure Diffusion Result
summary: >-
  Two-stage evaluation of the founder-authority-diffusion-vs-survival experiment. Stage A (calibration gate) recomputes Avelino
  et al. (ESEM 2019)'s three headline aggregate statistics -- Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD) incidence rate, share
  of TFDDs at TF=1, and overall 18-month survival rate -- over the 15-repo dataset dependency's raw commit event log, with
  95% Wilson CIs and PASS/FLAG_DEVIATION status per check, plus a snapshot-null Cohen's d replication and a 4-step diagnostic
  protocol (strata composition, abandoner-threshold parameter, hand-traced DOA sanity check, alias-collapse-rate spot check)
  that runs automatically whenever any check is flagged. Stage B runs five robustness/confound-freedom checks against the
  main experiment's founder-only-TFDD diffusion-vs-survival finding: (6) window-boundary sensitivity across a near/far/end-offset
  grid with BH-corrected logistic-regression p-values per variant and a sign-stability verdict; (7) founder-identification-heuristic
  sensitivity (first-commit author vs first-calendar-year plurality vs highest-lifetime-DOA) with a disagreement rate; (8)
  an age-at-TFDD confound check comparing diffusion-coefficient sign/significance before and after adding repo age as a covariate,
  plus VIF and a founder-share-vs-age correlation; (9) matched-pairs bucket-definition sensitivity (quartile vs log-scale
  star bins) with bootstrap CIs on the survival lift; and (10) an explicit permutation test (random relocation of the pre-departure
  window within project history) yielding a two-sided permutation p-value, split by eventual survivors vs non-survivors. All
  rate/effect-size outputs carry 95% CIs (Wilson for proportions, >=1000-resample bootstrap otherwise) and multi-test families
  are BH-adjusted. The three hypothesis success criteria are re-scored PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with exact numeric evidence, and
  an overall verdict integrates the Stage A gate with the Stage B evidence. On this run: n_corpus=15, Stage A gate=FLAG_DEVIATION
  (small opportunistic sample vs Avelino's 1932-repo stratified corpus, so CIs are wide but still miss two of three reference
  rates), n_founder_tfdd_events=5 (severely underpowered for regression/permutation inference), and overall verdict=DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_PIPELINE_UNCALIBRATED
  -- the evaluation's central, actionable finding is that the pipeline needs a substantially larger corpus before its diffusion-vs-survival
  claim can be trusted, not that the effect itself is false. A prior execution attempt crashed the container because check10's
  permutation test called the O(n_commits) DOA-recomputation routine ~5000 times (bundles x 1000 permutations) with no caching,
  which this run fixed by hard-capping permutations to 60/40 draws -- eval.py now completes end-to-end in ~165s. Downstream
  artifacts should read eval_out.json's stage_a_calibration.gate_status and stage_b_robustness fields, and treat the power_caveat
  field in final_scoring as load-bearing given n_founder_tfdd_events=5.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json, os

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    if os.path.exists("mini_demo_data.json"):
        with open("mini_demo_data.json") as f: return json.load(f)
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-24ffbe-pre-departure-bus-factor-diffusion/main/round-1/evaluation-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

Stage A (calibration gate) recomputes Avelino et al. (ESEM 2019)'s three headline aggregate statistics -- Truck-Factor-Detachment-Departure (TFDD) incidence rate, share of TFDDs at TF=1, and overall 18-month survival rate -- over the 15-repo dataset dependency's raw commit event log, with 95% Wilson CIs and PASS/FLAG_DEVIATION status per check, plus a snapshot-null Cohen's d replication and a 4-step diagnostic protocol (strata composition, abandoner-threshold parameter, hand-traced DOA sanity check, alias-collapse-rate spot check) that runs automatically whenever any check is flagged. Stage B runs five robustness/confound-freedom checks against the main experiment's founder-only-TFDD diffusion-vs-survival finding: (6) window-boundary sensitivity across a near/far/end-offset grid with BH-corrected logistic-regression p-values per variant and a sign-stability verdict; (7) founder-identification-heuristic sensitivity (first-commit author vs first-calendar-year plurality vs highest-lifetime-DOA) with a disagreement rate; (8) an age-at-TFDD confound check comparing diffusion-coefficient sign/significance before and after adding repo age as a covariate, plus VIF and a founder-share-vs-age correlation; (9) matched-pairs bucket-definition sensitivity (quartile vs log-scale star bins) with bootstrap CIs on the survival lift; and (10) an explicit permutation test (random relocation of the pre-departure window within project history) yielding a two-sided permutation p-value, split by eventual survivors vs non-survivors. All rate/effect-size outputs carry 95% CIs (Wilson for proportions, >=1000-resample bootstrap otherwise) and multi-test families are BH-adjusted. The three hypothesis success criteria are re-scored PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with exact numeric evidence, and an overall verdict integrates the Stage A gate with the Stage B evidence. On this run: n_corpus=15, Stage A gate=FLAG_DEVIATION (small opportunistic sample vs Avelino's 1932-repo stratified corpus, so CIs are wide but still miss two of three reference rates), n_founder_tfdd_events=5 (severely underpowered for regression/permutation inference), and overall verdict=DOES_NOT_SUPPORT_PIPELINE_UNCALIBRATED -- the evaluation's central, actionable finding is that the pipeline needs a substantially larger corpus before its diffusion-vs-survival claim can be trusted, not that the effect itself is false. A prior execution attempt crashed the container because check10's permutation test called the O(n_commits) DOA-recomputation routine ~5000 times (bundles x 1000 permutations) with no caching, which this run fixed by hard-capping permutations to 60/40 draws -- eval.py now completes end-to-end in ~165s. Downstream artifacts should read eval_out.json's stage_a_calibration.gate_status and stage_b_robustness fields, and treat the power_caveat field in final_scoring as load-bearing given n_founder_tfdd_events=5.\",\n  \"out_expected_files\": {", "stderr": "", "interrupted": false, "isImage": false, "noOutputExpected": false}

The `.nb_env` cleanup (rm -rf of a 1.3GB directory) is running in the background via Monitor — I'll wait for its completion notification rather than polling.

Summary so far: I diagnosed and fixed the crash cause (the notebook ran fine — the previous crash was from misdiagnosing a slow-but-working install cell as hung, then getting stuck in an infinite polling loop). I re-tested the full notebook end-to-end with a local-fallback stand-in URL — it executed cleanly in ~5m13s with no errors and sensible Stage A/B output. The real `code_demo.ipynb` has the correct `GITHUB_DATA_URL`, `mini_demo_data.json` exists (894KB), and the struct output JSON has been written. Once the background cleanup finishes I'll do a final directory check and confirm completion.
```
