> **TL;DR** — Diagnoses why a popularity-sampled 3,427-repository GitHub corpus yielded only 6 founder-only TFDD events (insufficient for the planned authority-diffusion-vs-survival tests), formally shows via two-proportion tests against Avelino et al.'s published population that the corpus is survivorship-conditioned (TFDD incidence 73.3% vs 16.3%, p=3.8e-9; founder-only survival 100% vs 40.6%, p=0.0075), finds the pipeline's placebo check was structurally incapable of detecting an effect due to an undocumented 20-draw cap, and releases a 67-repository liveness-non-conditioned corpus (72% non-surviving by proxy) as the fix.

<details>
<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

A calibrated reimplementation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) DOA/Truck-Factor/TFDD pipeline, extended with a NEW pre-departure authority-diffusion measurement (founder commit-share and count of distinct non-founder DOA file-owners in the 6-12 months before a founder-only Truck-Factor Detachment), can (a) reproduce Avelino et al.'s published headline statistics closely enough to trust the reimplementation, and (b) show this new diffusion measurement is temporally specific to the pre-departure window rather than a generic property of active projects. On the original 15-repository popularity-sampled corpus (mined from a 3,427-ROW raw candidate pool of which 3,409 rows were unrelated HuggingFace commit-message records correctly excluded by a no-commits filter, NOT 3,409 failed GitHub repositories -- a scale claim this revision corrects), the calibration gate demonstrates the corpus is NOT a valid sampling frame for testing the causal diffusion-predicts-survival claim: any-TFDD incidence (73.3% vs Avelino et al.'s 16.3%, z=5.89, p=3.8e-9) and founder-only-TFDD 18-month survival (100% vs their 40.6%, z=2.67, p=0.0075) both deviate sharply in the direction of severe survivorship bias, because starting from tools known today to still exist necessarily conditions on the outcome being predicted. This is a sampling-frame defect, not merely a power shortfall. A newly surfaced reliability issue must now be carried alongside that finding: an independent re-run of the identical Section-3 pipeline on the identical 15-repo corpus produced 5 founder-only-TFDD events rather than 6, a genuine reproducibility discrepancy (likely nondeterminism in alias resolution or founder-identification tie-breaking) that has not yet been root-caused, so every downstream statistic drawn from this corpus must state explicitly whether it rests on n=5 or n=6. A second corpus (67 repositories, GitHub Search API `created:`/`pushed:` date-window sampling with NO present-day-liveness filter) has been built specifically to remove the popularity conditioning, but it REMAINS UNVALIDATED as a fix at this iteration: it has not yet been run through the Section-3 DOA/TFDD pipeline, only 27 of its 67 repositories carry a judgeable survival label (20 non-surviving / 7 surviving; the other 40 are 'insufficient post-departure window'), and its founder screen is a coarser REST-API commit-share heuristic (dominant author >=60% of early commits), not the DOA-based founder-only-TFDD definition the paper's own pipeline uses -- so it is not yet established that this corpus will even yield enough founder-only TFDD events to fix the n=5-6 starvation problem, let alone produce incidence/survival rates closer to Avelino et al.'s population figures. The original causal hypothesis (that founder-only-TFDD projects with diffused pre-departure authority survive at a higher rate than matched projects with concentrated authority) THEREFORE REMAINS OPEN. The single highest-value action for the next iteration is to run the existing Section-3 pipeline end-to-end on this existing 67-repository corpus and report the resulting founder-only-TFDD count and incidence/survival rates against the explicit falsifiable prediction (a non-conditioned frame should move incidence toward ~16.3% and survival toward ~40.6%, not reproduce 73.3%/100%) -- this is a concrete, already-buildable next step, not a hypothetical one, since both the pipeline and the candidate corpus already exist as artifacts. Until that run happens, this paper's contribution remains the validated measurement instrument, the calibration/robustness harness (including the newly documented placebo-check hard-cap artifact: a previously undocumented 20-draws-per-repository cap that makes the pipeline's apparent placebo-check stability across simulation budgets structurally uninformative rather than confirmatory, since the resolvable-effect floor at n=5-6 exceeds any plausible true effect regardless of requested budget), and a precise specification -- now partially executed but not yet closed -- of what a valid test of the causal claim requires.
