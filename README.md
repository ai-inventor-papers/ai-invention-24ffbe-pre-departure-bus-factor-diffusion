> **TL;DR** — A second, methodologically strengthened test of whether pre-departure authority diffusion predicts open-source project survival, using a single unified 32-repository founder-only TFDD corpus, a 300-draw placebo control, and a new window-boundary-noise floor derived from stable-period recomputation on 13 held-out repositories. All three pre-registered criteria fail again, but now diagnosably: the regression runs to completion and the diffusion covariate trails snapshot controls by more than 2x with no significance; the matched-pairs test is untestable on a genuine floor effect; and the placebo test's striking 3rd-percentile result does not clear the noise floor, falling within 1.4 of the pre-registered 2-SD signal threshold. A supplementary bootstrap CI and manual identity-resolution audit bound two previously unmeasured data-quality risks.

<details>
<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

An open-source project's survival after its founder-only Truck-Factor-Developer-Detachment (TFDD, Avelino et al. ESEM 2019) was hypothesized to depend more on how diffused DOA-based commit/file authority already was among non-founder contributors in the 6-12 months before departure than on snapshot covariates (popularity, size, developer/commit/file counts) measured at the moment of departure, which Avelino et al. show are only negligibly-to-weakly different between survivors and non-survivors (d=0.13-0.26). This iteration ran all three pre-registered tests to completion for the first time, on a unified 32-repository founder-only-TFDD corpus, and the result is now a genuine, diagnosable NEGATIVE: (1) the BH-FDR logistic regression (12 predictors, 1000-resample bootstrap p-values) runs cleanly and the diffusion proxy -- count of new non-founder DOA file-owners pre-departure, NOT founder commit share, which is degenerate (zero-variance in 31/32 repos and therefore untestable in this corpus) -- has standardized effect 0.133 vs a control-covariate mean of 0.345 (BH-adjusted p=0.84 over the 12 predictors), falling well short of both significance and the snapshot covariates it was meant to beat; the only BH-FDR-significant predictors are project age and a language indicator, i.e. snapshot-like properties, not trajectory. (2) The matched-pairs test remains structurally untestable, but now for a diagnosed reason -- a genuine floor effect (28/32 repos fall in the high-diffusion stratum at every caliper width) rather than ambiguous small counts. (3) The placebo test's true-window statistic sits at an individually striking 3rd percentile of a well-resolved 300-draw null (r=-0.246, null mean 0.044, SD 0.176) -- but per reviewer critique, the paper's claim that this is indistinguishable from a purpose-built 'window-boundary-noise floor' is UNVERIFIED at the scale reported: the noise-floor control's provenance (independent held-out non-TFDD repositories vs. the same 32 analysis-corpus repositories' own stable periods) is internally inconsistent between the paper text and the underlying experiment artifact and must be resolved before the 'noise, not signal' interpretation can be trusted, and the '1.4 SD' comparison mixes a raw-covariate variance scale with a correlation-null SD scale without a shown conversion -- so as of this iteration, the placebo result's status is UNRESOLVED, not confirmed-as-noise. Taken together: the trajectory-vs-snapshot mechanism has now been tested at adequate power on two of three criteria and both fail cleanly (regression, matched-pairs); the third (placebo) produced the most signal-like result in this line of work but its interpretation as noise rests on an internally contradictory and under-specified control that must be corrected -- either by fixing the provenance description to match what the code actually did, or by rebuilding the noise-floor control as a genuinely independent, same-scale (correlation-statistic) comparison -- before any claim about it can stand. Confidence in the core mechanism should now be lowered rather than held flat: on the two tests that could be unambiguously interpreted, the diffusion signal did not appear, and any residual hope for the hypothesis rests entirely on an unresolved methodological question about the third.
