> **TL;DR** — We reimplement and calibrate Avelino et al.'s Truck-Factor pipeline, add a new pre-departure authority-diffusion measurement whose permutation-test construct validity we confirm, and use a formal calibration gate to show that a convenience corpus of currently-famous repositories is a structurally inconsistent (not merely underpowered) sampling frame for testing whether that diffusion predicts survival -- reframing the paper as a validated instrument plus a precise specification of the corpus a follow-up study needs.

<details>
<summary>Full hypothesis</summary>

A calibrated reimplementation of Avelino et al.'s (ESEM 2019) DOA/Truck-Factor/TFDD pipeline, extended with a NEW pre-departure authority-diffusion measurement (founder commit-share and count of distinct non-founder DOA file-owners in the 6-12 months before a founder-only Truck-Factor Detachment), can (a) reproduce Avelino et al.'s published headline statistics closely enough to trust the reimplementation, and (b) show this new diffusion measurement is temporally specific to the pre-departure window rather than a generic property of active projects, measured via a SINGLE canonical, source-verified permutation scheme reported once (not two divergent configurations). On a 15-repository convenience corpus built by starting from currently-famous, still-maintained tools, the calibration gate demonstrates this corpus is NOT a valid sampling frame for testing the causal diffusion-predicts-survival claim: TFDD incidence (73.3% vs Avelino et al.'s 16.3%, z=5.98, p=1.5e-6) and 18-month survival (100% vs their 40.6%, z=2.70, p=0.011) both deviate sharply in the direction of severe survivorship bias, because starting from tools known today to still exist necessarily conditions on the outcome being predicted. A second, liveness-non-conditioned discovery attempt (GH Archive-style search over archived/stale repos, 700 candidates found but only ~28 actually attempted for extraction, yielding 1 usable repo) independently corroborates the mechanism but is explicitly reported as a small, possibly unrepresentative attempted-subsample, not a characterization of the full 700-candidate pool's true base rate -- resolving that gap (via a larger random subsample of the 700, or an explicit caveat) is now a required part of the corpus-construction claim rather than an incidental detail. This is a sampling-frame defect, not merely a power shortfall -- a larger sample drawn from the same 'currently-famous tools' frame would remain biased toward survivors and unable to test the causal claim. The original causal hypothesis (that founder-only-TFDD projects with diffused pre-departure authority survive at a higher rate than matched projects with concentrated authority) THEREFORE REMAINS OPEN, with zero outcome variance across all founder-only TFDD events observed to date (5 of 5 survived), and is reframed as the target of a specific, well-defined follow-up: a corpus constructed from a historical snapshot of GitHub repositories that does NOT condition on present-day liveness, extended via the already-built, checkpointed candidate pipeline and an authenticated GitHub token, yielding an estimated ~40 founder-only TFDD events -- the threshold this study's own fallback power analysis identifies as needed (an n>=10-complete-rows requirement whose statistical basis, e.g. an events-per-variable rule of thumb, must be explicitly cited rather than asserted as an unexplained cutoff). Given that this causal claim remains untested after two independent corpus-construction attempts, this paper's own framing must now explicitly address whether it is submitted as a full empirical-contribution paper (contingent on executing the token-enabled expansion to obtain at least one non-survivor before resubmission) or repositioned for a negative-results/tools-and-datasets track where a rigorously validated null/instrumentation contribution, honestly reported as such including in its title-level framing, is the appropriate bar. Until either the causal test is run or the venue framing is adjusted, this paper's contribution is the validated measurement instrument and calibration/robustness harness (pipeline replication, diagnostic gate, single canonical construct-validity check for the diffusion measurement with bot-account contamination explicitly ruled out on the founder-only-TFDD subset, and explicit positioning against CHAOSS's own reference-implementation tooling for longitudinal Contributor Absence Factor) plus a precise specification of what a valid test of the causal claim requires -- not an empirical answer to whether diffusion predicts survival.
